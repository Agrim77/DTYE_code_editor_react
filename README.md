## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Create an online code editor using React that supports the features given in document by DYTE.

## EXPLANATION

I made online code-editor for HTML, CSS, JS code snippets using only HTML, CSS and React. The code editorâ€™s functionality were similar to that of codpen.io but with added feature of file explorer.

- I made a tab bar for file explorer functionality. It has 3 tabs: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Below that I made a text editor using codemirror library. It supports syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JS.
- At bottom, I made an area for live preview using iframe and set a delay of 250ms before output appears.
